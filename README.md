# text-gen-cm2
Generate save codes for text with text blocks in Circuit Maker 2

**DISCLAIMER:** This tool isn't a virus. 13 antiviruses detect it as Trojan.Cerbu because it creates a file called "output.txt", which can be one of the steps of Trojan.Cerbu. We will eventually fix this, don't worry.

1) open cm2

(then you should see a menu like this)

6) paste in the text from "output.txt" (make sure you press enter)
